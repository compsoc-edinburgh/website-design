Hey!

It's only in PHP at the moment so I can chop it up easily;
Had PHP installed already.
A live version is up on http://enginger.me/compsoc

Notes and ToDos for the HTML&CSS
================================

 * 3 level Responsive CSS with @media queries. >1200px, >900px & phones
 * Styles for different types of page, i.e. KnowledgeBase (basically a wiki), News (Content stream (Facebook, Twatter, IRC)), Specials like Sponsors, and the join page(Google/Facebook signup)
 * More usery stuff, like login, profile page CSS, stuff like that
